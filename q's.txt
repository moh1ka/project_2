 Q -  Difference between using power domain and freq domain??????
	power domain is squared,mag is exagereated
	(N.B.) k is between 0 and 1

 Q -  Enhance 2&5 ?????
	explained on paper(short exp at the bottom)

 Q -  Spectogram???????
	how to :
 	turn on enhancement, connnect board output
	to computer, open sound recorder, save it somewhere,
	open matlab and do shortwave fourier transform on that

 Q -   A SET OR A SINGLE ALGORYTHM???????
	Choose a COMBO that will make a difference on all
	audio files


enahcnement 1: lpf only does smoothing effect on variation of amplitude
not really a lpf where we get rid of high freq components.
so for enhancement 2, theoretically there exists a k that make 1&2 the 
same, but if we keep the k we have the same, then the output we have
would be different. 1 would be more smother, 2(since is sqaured, high will
be higher, low will be lower//exagerate things)would be more vibrant. 
it cannot say which one would make the speech sounds better(smoother
does not mean better and varians does not mean worse. there is a 
point/theroshold)

for enhancement 5: make a difference on selection of G
		   G smaller, makes the noise supression harsher
			(5 is worse at noise reduction/supression)

for enahncement 2: use cabs value instead of complex to do a fair comparison
