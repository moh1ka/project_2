2,8, tau_3 = 0.02 tau = 0.08 alpha = 4, intro duction of 8 reduces noise but increases musical noise
only 2 removes 'white noise' but also reduces the speech volume
only 1 dpoes the same but speech volume is not comprimised
4 on its own doesn't sound tha tgreat, speech is comprimsed but high freq noises are reduced
1+4 sound best, a happy union!

It is difficult to hear a difference using 8 with other enhancements, however, on its own it is clear that 8 is reducing the musical noise
no enhancements, a lot of musical noise!
5.1: helicoptor noise, choppy speech
5.2: helicoptor noise is still present, but better
5.3: higher pritvhed noise but low freq seems to be better - a bit owrse than 4.2, the noise is a bit louder and higher pitched
than 5.3

4.3 and 5.4 cut all sound all together
5.5 very similar to 4 but adds more musical noise
